<h2>Description</h2>
<div>
    <p>When it comes to fudge, most people tend to think of it only around Christmas time. But fudge is actually perfect to make during the summer too because it’s a simple no-bake treat!</p>
    <p>Since it’s been extremely hot lately and the last thing most of us want to do right now is turn our ovens on, I wanted to share my easy homemade fudge recipe with you. And when I say easy, I really mean it! This fudge only requires three simple ingredients, takes just a few minutes to throw together, and you don’t even need a candy thermometer. </p>
    <p>I love to make this fudge with semi-sweet chocolate chips, but white chocolate chips work great with this recipe too. I’ve also included a few different recipe variations that you can try with this fudge to show you just how versatile it can be!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<div>
    <ul><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> You’ll be using three cups of chocolate chips for this fudge. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips, but feel free to swap them for white chocolate chips or even dark chocolate.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Sweetened condensed milk:</strong> You’ll need one 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk. I suggest sticking with the regular version and skipping the fat-free kind.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Butter:</strong> You can technically make this fudge with just the first two ingredients, but I’ve found that adding just a couple tablespoons of butter helps create a smoother consistency. Trust me here!</ul>
    <ul><strong>Chopped Walnuts:</strong> This ingredient is completely optional! If you don’t love nuts, feel free to leave them out. You can even swap the chopped walnuts with chopped pecans too.</ul>

<br><h3>Steps</h3>
<div>
    <p>To make this fudge, you’ll start out by combining everything in a large saucepan. Then, place the saucepan over medium heat and stir the mixture continuously until it’s nice and smooth. I suggest using a rubber spatula to scrape the bottom and sides of the saucepan so that none of the chocolate burns.</p>
    <p>Once the mixture is completely smooth, remove it from the heat and scoop it into an 8-inch square baking dish. I like to line my dish with parchment paper or foil and leave some overhang before adding the fudge. This will make it much easier to lift it out of the pan and slice the fudge!
    </p>
    <p>You’ll spread the fudge into one even layer, then cover it, and place it in the refrigerator. It will take about 3 hours to fully firm up, so you can even prep this the night before too.
